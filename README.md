# BT4012-Fraud-Job-Posting

Due to GitHub constraints, we are unable to upload all the files we used to GitHub as certain files such as pre-trained glove models take up gigabytes of space. We will attach a google drive link in the final report containing a link to the required files we used.

Also, we shifted to a new repo for cleanliness purposes.
